# Decentralized Disaster Relief Coordination Platform

A blockchain-based platform enabling efficient coordination of disaster relief efforts through transparent resource tracking, need assessment, and volunteer management. The system ensures rapid response while maintaining accountability for all resources and activities.

## System Architecture

### Need Assessment Contract
Tracks and prioritizes relief requirements:
- Real-time need reporting
- Priority calculation
- Resource requirement tracking
- Location mapping
- Severity assessment
- Population impact tracking
- Time sensitivity monitoring
- Status updates

### Resource Allocation Contract
Manages aid distribution:
- Supply chain tracking
- Inventory management
- Distribution planning
- Last-mile delivery
- Resource matching
- Efficiency optimization
- Waste prevention
- Impact measurement

### Volunteer Management Contract
Coordinates volunteer activities:
- Volunteer registration
- Skill matching
- Deployment coordination
- Time tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Safety management
- Communication coordination
- Certificate issuance

### Donation Tracking Contract
Ensures transparent fund management:
- Donation processing
- Fund allocation
- Expense tracking
- Impact reporting
- Donor communication
- Audit trail
- Receipt generation
- Performance metrics

## Usage Examples

### Report Emergency Need

```solidity
await NeedAssessmentContract.reportNeed({
    locationId: "LOC-123",
    coordinates: {
        lat: 30.2672,
        long: -97.7431
    },
    need: {
        type: "MEDICAL",
        urgency: "HIGH",
        population: 500,
        details: "Emergency medical supplies needed",
        requirements: ["ANTIBIOTICS", "FIRST_AID", "VACCINES"]
    },
    conditions: {
        access: "LIMITED",
        infrastructure: "DAMAGED",
        weather: "SEVERE"
    }
});
```

### Allocate Resources

```solidity
await ResourceAllocationContract.allocateResources({
    requestId: "REQ-123",
    resources: [{
        type: "MEDICAL_SUPPLIES",
        quantity: 1000,
        unit: "KITS",
        priority: "HIGH"
    }, {
        type: "WATER",
        quantity: 5000,
        unit: "LITERS",
        priority: "CRITICAL"
    }],
    logistics: {
        transportType: "HELICOPTER",
        eta: "2025-03-15T10:00:00Z",
        route: "ROUTE-456",
        restrictions: ["WEATHER_DEPENDENT"]
    }
});
```

### Register Volunteer

```solidity
await VolunteerManagementContract.registerVolunteer({
    volunteerId: "VOL-123",
    personal: {
        name: "John Doe",
        contact: "john@example.com",
        location: "Austin, TX",
        availability: "IMMEDIATE"
    },
    skills: [{
        type: "MEDICAL",
        level: "ADVANCED",
        certification: "EMT-CERTIFIED"
    }, {
        type: "LOGISTICS",
        level: "INTERMEDIATE",
        experience: "5_YEARS"
    }],
    preferences: {
        deploymentRange: 100, // km
        duration: 14, // days
        restrictions: ["NO_AIR_TRAVEL"]
    }
});
```

### Process Donation

```solidity
await DonationTrackingContract.processDonation({
    donationId: "DON-123",
    donor: {
        id: "DONOR-456",
        type: "ORGANIZATION",
        anonymous: false
    },
    amount: ethers.utils.parseEther("10.0"),
    allocation: {
        medical: 0.4,
        water: 0.3,
        food: 0.3
    },
    restrictions: {
        region: "TEXAS",
        useCase: "HURRICANE_RELIEF"
